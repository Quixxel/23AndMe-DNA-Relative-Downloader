# 23AndMe-DNA-Relative-Downloader
 Downloads the list of your DNA relatives from 23AndMe using Selenium

Usage:
1. Install the Selenium driver for your browser, e.g. https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started
2. In downloader.py, replace [path_to_selenium_driver].exe with the correct path
3. Run the downloader with "python downloader.py", install python and necessary packages if needed
4. When the 23AndMe login screen appears, log in
5. Return to the terminal you launched the script from and hit enter
6. Wait 15 minutes or so
7. A list of your DNA relatives should be in the folder you ran the script in, if there was an error run it again, sometimes the 23AndMe website crashes


This worked for me but might not work for you, there's no warranty, no refunds, etc.
